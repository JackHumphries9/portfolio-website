Well, after eight months of studying, I've finally finished my first year of university and I feel relieved! It has been enjoyable adjusting to this new way of working and learning. It's pretty exhausting balancing Tinder dates and studying. But seriously though, I have done loads of work this year and it feels good to finally have some time to work on personal projects. Doing all these assignments has taught me quite a lot. One of the biggest lessons I've learnt is to read the mark scheme on an assignment.
