Hello World! Yeah I've finally got around to it! May I present my brand new website which is completely coded from the ground up to give you an overview of me and my skills. This new website is so much superior and better than my old one. Plus, I've even got a shiny new domain name [jackhumphries.io](https://jackhumphries.io). This article is the first to be written and it will give you a brief overview of how this is much better and possibly plans for the future.

By the way you can check out the source code [here](https://github.com/JackHumphries9/portfolio-website).

### The Reason for the Rebuild

So you may be wondering why I decided to rewrite my website. There were many reasons I wanted to rewrite my website. I'm going to be frank for a minute, I used a template for the old one. In fact, it was [this](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/rubik-presentation-page) exact template. If you view the preview it will look very familiar. When I originally "wrote" the website, I didn't see the point in React or any other framework. I thought it was all rubbish and I loved Bootstrap and HTML. Also, I wanted a central place to have my blog and works easily modifiable and in one place. After two years and many lockdowns due to a certain virus, I have learnt so much about web development and realised how bad HTML is. (Yeah I get HTML has it's uses but I don't think that it was a good idea for this project). This prompted me to begin to think about rewriting it.

Just gonna put this out there and say that I find CSS absolutely painful. We covered it partially at University and I just hate it. Nothing does what you want it to. This detered me for a bit until one day I was inspired. A YouTuber by the name of [devaslife](https://www.youtube.com/devaslife) made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSMZgXzC9AA) where he built a portfolio website with [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org) and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com). This really did inspire me and you may be able to spot some similarities between my website and his. So, at this point I did so much Googling and decided to learn how these worked. And let me tell you, these libraries and frameworks are so good.

### The Technologies

So, this website is a [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org) website using [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com). It also uses [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for the animations. For the "backend" with the whole generated content stuff, I used [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org) too to statically generate the pages at build time. This means I just write a blog article or whatever, push to GitHub where [Vercel](https://vercel.com) will build and deploy my site. I initially wanted to build a full on API which would get blog articles and other items but I decided to not do this because it was very complicated for this project. I would have to set up a CDN, database and deploy the API. The blog system is pretty cool. I have even written a small CLI which allows me to create the template for a blog markdown file. Check it out [here](https://github.com/JackHumphries9/create-jh-article).

I mean the reason I went with these choices was mainly because I had always wanted to build a website with [React](https://reactjs.org) but I didn't have skills or any ideas for one. [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) was an easy choice because like I said I cannot do CSS for the life of me! [Vercel](https://vercel.com) is another obvious choice for me because it is an absolutely incredbile platform.

### What I have learnt

So I think the main think I have learnt from this project is how to write a good website with [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org) and [React](https://reactjs.org). Also, I have learnt valuable skills in sticking to a project and making sure it is done to a high quality. I am really glad that I decided to do this as sometimes I start projects and don't finish them.

So yeah thank you for reading if you got this far and I hope you enjoy this brand new website. I already have a million ideas for blog articles and other things that I can't wait to share here.
